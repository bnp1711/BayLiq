## Background Idea

There is a huge number of cryptocurrencies in the world of cryptocurrencies, and there is not a single cryptoexchange in the world where you can buy any cryptocurrency. Thus, most customers use several crypto exchanges to buy cryptocurrencies. According to statistics, from 3 to 8 crypto exchanges, 1 - 5 cold wallets, as well as all kinds of exchange applications that also have a balance on the account.

After conducting the research, we realized that also the majority of cryptocurrency holders who have large account balances keep their cryptocurrency on "Cold Wallets" for the security of their content. Given this, they do not have the ability to continuously track cryptocurrency rates in US dollars, Euros, and so on.

The main concept of the Bayliq project is an application that combines all cryptocurrency exchanges that can be added automatically or manually, in any order to the Bayliq application, and which also shows the total balance of all cryptocurrencies and also specifically each cryptocurrency separately.

Including shows the balance of the so-called "Cold wallets" (Trezor, Letger and others). The balance will be entered manually "incognito" as well as automatically using software and agreements with the main (30) crypto exchanges in the world.

There will also be an opportunity to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.
